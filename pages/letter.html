Heloo Chotu,

You know, I was thinking back on these past four years, and it’s just wild how we’ve grown. You were the one person I ever reached out to first, December 4th, and boom, we started talking. Those COVID days were a blast, just us, nonstop, until we finally met in person on November 17th. I was in awe, totally smitten. We walked to my flat, 4 kilometers and even though you were dealing with stuff, you powered through. I was trying to be protective, awkwardly (not trying to be touchy touchy uk hihi) , but man, that day stuck.

From there, we went from friends to best friends. The day we called each other best friends? I was on top of the world. Then things just got closer and closer, until I proposed. Even though I knew deep down you’d say yes, I was still so nervous. But when you did, everything changed.... life actually got more magical.

And now, every memory is like a scene from “Kaise Mujhe Tum Mil Gayi.” I don’t know how I got so lucky, but I did. You’ve made every day brighter, and I’m just so glad you’re here with me.

Always yours (and always smiling because of you!).
